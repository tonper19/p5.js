Setting up p5.js with an editor on your own computer
To run p5.js in your computer you will need a text editor. You can use the code editor of your choice. Instructions for getting set up with Sublime Text 2 are included below, other good editor options include Brackets and Atom. If you are a screen reader user and not using the p5 web editor, you may want to use Notepad++ or Eclipse.

Downloading a copy of the p5.js library
The easiest way to start is by using the empty example that comes with the p5.js complete download.

After download, you need to set up a local server. See instructions here . Run your local server within the downloaded folder and on your browser, go to http://localhost:{your-port-num}/empty-example

If you look in index.html, you'll notice that it links to the file p5.js. If you would like to use the minified version (compressed for faster page loading), change the link to p5.min.js.

<script src="../p5.min.js"></script>
